Qt Event order

stealer click <- event filter on child
child mouse press event <- child widget virtual function
snooper click <- event filter on parent
parent mouse press <- parent virtual function
child mouse double <- double child, the default implementation of double calls single mouse press
child mouse press event <- double child 2
snooper double click <- filter on parent
mouse double click <- parent (default)

double clicks first look for a double click handler,
 if it doesn't exist then the default forwards the event to the single click handler

Events start at the children and propagate down. Calling ignore() or ::event returning false
makes a widget pass on the event to children.
 ignore and accept are opposites

Typical:
 1. filter
 2. ::event()
 3. virtual mousePressEvent

QGraphicsView is all messed up
 0. QAbstractScrollArea::viewportEvent
 1. view mousePressEvent
  2. scene ::event()
   3. scene mousePressEvent
 (quit if view accept, continue if ignore)
 4. filter
 5. ::event()
