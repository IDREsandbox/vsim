Qt Event order

stealer click <- event filter on child
child mouse press event <- child widget virtual function
snooper click <- event filter on parent
parent mouse press <- parent virtual function
child mouse double <- double child, the default implementation of double calls single mouse press
child mouse press event <- double child 2
snooper double click <- filter on parent
mouse double click <- parent (default)

double clicks first look for a double click handler,
 if it doesn't exist then the default forwards the event to the single click handler

i have no clue what accept does
