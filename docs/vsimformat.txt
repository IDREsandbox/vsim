The narrative formats are pretty much the same, 
New .nar Format (vsim/osgb/osgt)
Old .nar Format (osgb)	



Model loading logic

Open should always be vsim/osgb/osgt

vsim?
 old format
 new format

osgb/osgt?
 this might be a vsim file, not sure...

load it as is, into an osg::Node
 look for the following and create if they don't exist:
  "Narratives"
  "Models"
  "ModelInformation"
  mark the root as "vsim"
 look for the following in root, and move to the correct groups OR convert if necessary:
  ::Narrative
  ::ModelInformation with no name, give it a name


Import

vsim/osgb/osgt
 this is really complicated... it should be the same as load, but append Narratives and Models
 we might need to add a "vsim" tag somewhere to distinguish (like the root name)
 1. convert to new format
 2. merge with 


osg/obj/fbx/dae/skt/flt/etc?
 this is a raw model, do importing instead


Export

vsim/osgb/osgt
 export as is







The flow of things

reset 
  calls init(new Group)
init
  cleans up old stuff
  calls convertToNewVSim
convertToNewVSim
