# vcpkg

Make sure you have at least 30GB before doing this. These build trees are kind of enormous, and can take several hours to build. You can delete the big buildtrees folder afterwards.

intalling vcpkg
you probably have to switch to powershell to run the bat
```
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg
cd vcpkg

./bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
./vcpkg integrate install
```

building
```
./vcpkg install flatbuffers:x64-windows osg:x64-windows qt5-base:x64-windows cryptopp:x64-windows assimp:x64-windows
```

packaging
```
./vcpkg export flatbuffers:x64-windows osg:x64-windows qt5-base:x64-windows cryptopp:x64-windows assimp:x64-windows --7zip
```


# The old way

Download CMake and add it to PATH https://cmake.org/download/
CMake is used to build releases from the command prompt.


# Building OpenSceneGraph

```
git clone https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph.git
cd OpenSceneGraph
git checkout tags/OpenSceneGraph-3.5.6 #or whatever version you want
```

## Dependencies file structure

- 3rdParty-build
    - x64
- OpenSceneGraph (source)
- osg-build
    - install
  
## Building third party

Don't build third party, it's too hard -.-

Download 2017 third party packages here

## Building osg

```
	mkdir osg-build
	cd osg-build
	THIRDPARTY=C:/Users/David/Desktop/dependencies/3rdParty-build/x64
	cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"\
	  -DACTUAL_3RDPARTY_DIR=$THIRDPARTY\
	  -DCOLLADA_BOOST_FILESYSTEM_LIBRARY=$THIRDPARTY/lib/boost_filesystem-vc141-mt-1_63.lib\
	  -DCOLLADA_BOOST_FILESYSTEM_LIBRARY_DEBUG=$THIRDPARTY/lib/boost_container-vc141-mt-gd-1_63.lib\
	  -DCOLLADA_BOOST_SYSTEM_LIBRARY=$THIRDPARTY/lib/boost_system-vc141-mt-1_63.lib\
	  -DCOLLADA_BOOST_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_DEBUG=$THIRDPARTY/lib/boost_system-vc141-mt-gd-1_63.lib\
	  -DCOLLADA_DOM_ROOT=$THIRDPARTY/include\
	  -DCOLLADA_DYNAMIC_LIBRARY=$THIRDPARTY/lib/collada-dom2.4-dp-vc141-mt.lib\
	  -DCOLLADA_DYNAMIC_LIBRARY_DEBUG=$THIRDPARTY/lib/collada-dom2.4-dp-vc141-mt-d.lib\
	  -DCOLLADA_INCLUDE_DIR=$THIRDPARTY/include\
	  -DBUILD_OSG_PLUGIN_NVTT=0\
	  ../OpenSceneGraph
```

How to exclude broken plugins:
`-DBUILD_OSG_PLUGIN_NVTT=0`

## build it

```
	cmake --build .
	cmake --build . --config RELEASE
	cmake --build . --config DEBUG
	cmake --build . --config RELEASE --target INSTALL
```
