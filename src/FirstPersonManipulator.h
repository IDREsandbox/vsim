	// a smooth and responsive mouse is a bit complicated.
	// How smoothing works:
	// There is a target (x,y) which is modified by the dx and dy of mouse
	// movement. There is a lagging (x,y) which follows behind the target
	// exponentially based on smoothness (.75 = step .25 way every second).
	// The actual rotation is done by rotateByPixels which converts dx and dy
	// to yaw and pitch based on sensitivity (units of degrees/pixel).
	// +x is to the right
	// +y is down (Qt style)
	void mouseMove(int dx, int dy);

	// max speed is controlled exponentially by "ticks"
	// +4 ticks is double, -4 is half
